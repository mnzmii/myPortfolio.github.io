      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          I'm Muhd Nazmi, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Computer Network and Security at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.
          As a second-year undergraduate, I'm passionate about technology and its potential to solve real-world problems, particularly through secure and efficient digital experiences.
          My interests span both frontend and backend web development, with a growing focus on cybersecurity, system architecture, and user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy building responsive and accessible websites while also understanding how systems communicate securely over networks.
          This dual passion has led me to explore topics like web application security, penetration testing basics, and data privacy.
          In university, I've taken part in team-based projects that required not only technical knowledge but also project coordination, effective communication, and problem-solving.
          Whether I’m writing clean HTML/CSS, debugging JavaScript, or analyzing traffic flow in a secure network setup, I approach each task with curiosity and persistence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coursework, I actively seek professional growth by attending seminars, hackathons, and tech outreach programs like CelcomDigi’s UniConnect,
          where I’ve gained insight into current industry practices, AI applications, and innovation in Malaysian tech ecosystems.
          I’m always eager to expand my skill set, whether it’s refining my coding practices, deepening my understanding of network architecture or exploring new development frameworks.
          My goal is to build a career where I can blend technical depth with a strong sense of ethics, collaboration, and a passion for community-driven innovation.

      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          Outside of tech, I enjoy staying active and connected with the world around me. I often go jogging as a way to stay physically fit and clear my mind —
          it’s my go-to activity for recharging after a long day. I also have a growing interest in photography, especially capturing scenic landscapes and everyday moments.
          Whether it’s a quiet sunrise or an interesting street scene, I enjoy the creativity and perspective photography brings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I follow football regularly and enjoy playing badminton with friends whenever I get the chance.
          These hobbies help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and provide inspiration outside of the screen.
          I also like attending tech-related events, where I can meet new people, exchange ideas, and stay in touch with the evolving industry.
