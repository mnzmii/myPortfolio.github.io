                  <em>AI and Machine Learning</em>, <em>Data & Advanced Analytics</em>,

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Young Talent Programme:</strong> A two-year structured program designed to empower Malaysian youth. 
                  It offers networking opportunities, department rotations and leadership development. 
                  The program aims to nurture 800 – 1000 young Malaysians over the next five years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Signature Internship Program:</strong> A dual-track program that includes three months of in-store 
                  experience and one month in corporate placement. Interns build real-world skills like communication, 
                  teamwork, stakeholder management and problem-solving. Skills earned are officially certified, 
                  which will help in boosting their professional credibility.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
    
            <li>
              <strong>Human-AI Communication is All About Context:</strong> Interacting effectively with AI requires more than just instructions. Context and intentional communication are also play an important roles.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Good vs. Poor Communication:</strong> Poor communication happens when shared understanding is missing. The more context AI has, the more accurate its response. This also applies in human relationships, which is when we know someone well, we can say less and still can be understood.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Understanding Through Words:</strong> AI learns a lot about us from how we describe things using our senses (sight, taste, touch). For example, using ChatGPT to ask prompts like:
                  <ul>
                    <li>“If my favorite film is Gladiator, what other movies should I watch?”</li>
                    <li>“Does a Snickers bar taste more like chocolate cake or ayam goreng?”</li>
                    <li>“Does a rabbit feel more like cotton or a metal rod?”</li>
                  </ul>
                  These prompts will help AI learn our preferences, opinions and even emotional cues with just from words.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Automation vs. Machine Learning vs. Generative AI:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Follows fixed rules and is good for repetitive, predictable tasks (generating reports, web scraping, etc).</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Learns patterns from data to make predictions or recommendations (image classification, recommendation engines,  etc).</li>
                    <li><strong>Generative AI:</strong> Produces new content like text, music, or images by learning from vast language data (ChatGPT, content summarization, etc).</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Benefits of Internal AI Development:</strong> CelcomDigi builds its own data and AI solutions in-house, which provides:
